            <h3>Splash Erosion</h3>
            <p>Splash erosion is the first stage of erosion. It happens when raindrops hit bare soil.
                The explosive impact breaks up soil aggregates, causing individual soil particles to be 'splashed' onto the soil surface.
                The splashed particles can rise up to 60cm above the ground and travel up to 1.5 metres from the point of impact.
                The particles obstruct the spaces between soil aggregates, causing the soil to form a crust that reduces infiltration and increases runoff.
                Raindrops' impact loosens the material that holds it together, allowing small fragments to detach.
                If the rain continues, water collects on the ground, causing water flow on the land surface, which is referred to as surface water runoff.</p>

            <h3>Sheet Erosion</h3>
            <p>sheet erosion, detachment of soil particles by raindrop impact and their removal downslope by water flowing overland as a sheet instead of in definite channels or rills. A more or less uniform layer of fine particles is removed from the entire surface of an area, sometimes resulting in an extensive loss of rich topsoil. Sheet erosion commonly occurs on recently plowed fields or on other sites having poorly consolidated soil material with scant vegetative cover.</p>

            <h3>Rill Erosion</h3>
            <p>Rill erosion is a type of erosion that results in small, yet well defined streams. It happens when water from rainfall does not soak into the soil, but runs across it instead. The rills or small channels (often only 30cm deep) are caused when water running across the surface of the ground gathers in a natural depression in the soil, and erosion is concentrated as the water flows through the depression.</p>

            <h3>Gully Erosion</h3>
            <p>Gully erosion is a visible type of soil erosion that reduces soil productivity and restricts land access and use.
                Gully soil can also cause infrastructure damage by burying fence lines, silting up waterways, clogging road culverts, and filling dams and reservoirs.
                Suspended sediments from an eroding gully can degrade water quality. Nutrients and pesticides are attached to these fine colloidal clay particles, which can remain suspended for long periods of time, clogging groundwater aquifers, polluting watercourses, and endangering aquatic flora and fauna.
                Controlling gully erosion can be challenging and expensive. It may be justified on higher-quality soils where there is a reasonable chance of success, or in strategic locations such as where a road or building is under threat by an advancing gully.</p>

            <h3>Tunnel Erosion</h3>
            <p>Tunnel erosion is the removal of subsoil. When water penetrates through a soil crack or a hole where a root has decayed, the soil disperses and is carried away with the flow to leave a small tunnel.</p>

            <h3>Flooding</h3>
            <p>The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.</p>

    <p class="head-para">What is Soil Erosion? </p>
    <p class="head-para">Erosion is the loss of soil. As soil erodes, it loses nutrients, clogs rivers with dirt, and eventually turns the area into a desert. 
        Although erosion happens naturally, human activities can make it much worse</p>

        <h3>1) Plant grass and shrubs.</h3>
        <p>Bare soil is easily swept away by wind and water, the two main causes of erosion. Plant roots hold the soil together, while their leaves block rain and stop it from breaking the soil apart.Turf, ornamental grass, and low, spreading shrubs work best since they cover the soil completely.
            If you have any bare ground, try to establish plant cover as soon as possible to limit erosion.
            If the ground is mostly flat (slope of 3:1 or less), this might be enough to solve the problem. Steep slopes erode faster, so they need more protection.

        <h3>2) Add mulch or rocks</h3>
        <p> This will weigh down the soil and protect the seeds and young plants underneath from getting washed away. It also slows the absorption of water to reduce runoff. Grass clippings or bark chips work especially well.
            If you don’t plant anything, keep the soil covered with mulch. You can also add mulch around plants to add another layer of protection or to keep the soil warm.</p>

        <h3>3) Use mulch matting to hold vegetation on slopes</h3>
        <p>Simply lay the mat over your seeds or young plants. On steep slopes, dig a small trench at the top of the hill first. Lay the top of the mat in the trench, fill it up with soil, then fold the mat back over the top. This helps water run over the top of the mat, where the mat will slow it down, instead of traveling underneath it.
            Fiber mulch mats or erosion control mats are a layer of mulch held together in a fiber mesh. This structure holds the mulch together in areas where normal mulch would be washed or blown away.</p>

        <h3>4) Put down fiber logs</h3>
        <p>Another option for erosion control on steep slopes is a series of rolled up logs or "wattles" made from fibrous material (like straw). Water running down the slope will slow down when it hits the logs, soaking into the soil instead of carrying mud downhill. Put the logs down across the slope, 10 to 25 feet (3–8m) apart. Hold them in place with wooden stakes or sturdy, living plants.
            You can plant seeds directly in the logs to protect them while they grow.
            If you do plant seeds directly into the logs, you should still use stakes to hold the logs in place, at least until the seeds develop sturdy roots that go into the soil.</p>

        <h3>5) Build retaining walls</h3>
        <p>Badly eroded slopes will continue to collapse downhill until they are stabilized. A retaining wall at the base of the slope will block the soil and slow down the collapse. This gives grass or other plants time to grow and help the soil hold together.
            Give the wall a 2% slope on the side (perpendicular to the incline) so that water flows off to the side instead of pooling.
            You may build the wall from concrete blocks, rock, or wood. Only use wood treated with a preservative to prevent rot.
            Use retaining walls around flowerbeds and other raised soil areas as well.
            You may need local government approval to build these structures.
